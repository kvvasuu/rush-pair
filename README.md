## :globe_with_meridians: General info

**RushPair** is an app that randomly pairs users for anonymous conversations until both parties express a desire to get to know each other. The goal is to create natural connections, one conversation at a time.

The application has been deployed on Render - https://rush-pair-front.onrender.com.

Use these login credentials to fully test the application with dummy data, etc.:

Login: test@test.com

Password: 222222

#### Keep in mind that the application is still in the development phase and currently has only a few features.
#### Additionally, because it is deployed on the free Render plan, the server goes to sleep and when trying to wake it up, the first request may take longer (up to a minute), give it a moment.

## :eight_pointed_black_star: Features:

#### Live Chat :speech_balloon:

The app supports real-time chat with the following features:
- **Anonymous or revealed chats**: Chats can be anonymous or users can reveal their identities.

#### User Pairing System :two_hearts:
The app features a unique system for matching users for live chat sessions:

- **Random pairing**: Users are randomly paired for conversations, which is anonymous at first.
- **Mutual match**: If both users choose to reveal their identities after the conversation, a mutual match is created, allowing for continued interaction.

#### Registration and Login System :closed_lock_with_key:

#### Email Functionality :mailbox_with_mail:
RushPair uses Nodemailer for sending emails to users for various purposes, including:
- **Registration**: Sending confirmation emails to verify user accounts during the signup process.
- **Password reset**: Providing secure links to reset forgotten passwords.

This ensures reliable communication with users and enhances the overall user experience.

#### Backend :computer:

The app uses **MongoDB** and **Mongoose** for database management, ensuring secure and efficient data storage. The REST API handles user authentication, profile management, and real-time chat functionalities.
Additionally, Socket.IO is used to enable real-time communication between users, making live chat and pairing interactions seamless and dynamic.

This version highlights the pairing system and should give users a clear understanding of how the matching process works in your app.

## Setup

Before you run app you need to set up envioronmental variables which are URLs used by app. Of course theese variables are not part of this repository since one of them - MongoDB URL - is secret and should not be exposed.

Create .env file in frontend folder with variable called "VITE_SERVER_URL" e.g. "VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000" which is backend server URL - default "http://localhost:3000".

Create .env file in backend folder with variable called "MONGODB_KEY" e.g.:
```
mongodb+srv://RushPairUser:<db_password>@rushpair.jt6i9.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Rushpair
```
which is MongoDB URL. If you want to run this app you should connect to your MongoDB database.

This repository is using Concurrently to run both frontend and backend at the same time with one npm script - "start": 
```
concurrently \"npm run dev --prefix frontend\" \"npm run dev --prefix backend\"
```
so there is no need to run them separately. Just use "npm run start" in main package folder.


```
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:5173
npm run start // run both frontend and backend with concurrently 
```
