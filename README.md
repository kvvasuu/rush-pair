## :globe_with_meridians: General info

RushPair is an exciting speed friending app that brings people together for real-life interactions. Meet new people in a fun, fast-paced environment where anonymity is key. Each round, youâ€™ll have 3 minutes to chat with a randomly selected partner. If you both click, the match is revealed at the end of the game. Discover connections naturally, one conversation at a time.
